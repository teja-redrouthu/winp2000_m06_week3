# Learning About Linux

## Introduction
Linux is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system’s hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. These operating systems share the Linux kernel. It Comes in several “distributions” to serve different purposes. Debian, Ubuntu, Redhat are some of the examples. Brief history, distributions and some of the basic Linux commands are discussed below.

## Section 1: History of Linux
Linux is an O/S core originally written by Linus Torvalds. Now almost 10,000 developers including major technology companies like Intel and IBM are using.
A set of programs written by Richard Stallman and others. They are the GNU utilities.
The first version Linux 0.0.1 released in Sepetember 1991. The designation "Linux" was initially used by Torvalds only for the Linux kernel. The kernel was, however, frequently used together with other software, especially that of the GNU project. This quickly became the most popular adoption of GNU software. Linux is free and open-source, powerful for research datacenters, personal for desktops and phones.

## Section 2: Linux Distributions
Linux distributions, often referred to as Linux distros, are operating systems made from a software collection that is based upon the Linux kernel and, often, a package management system. They include the Linux kernel, supporting utilities and libraries, and usually a large amount of application software to fulfill the distribution’s intended use. Some of them are:
- Ubuntu: Ubuntu is a comprehensive operating system that combines advanced features, high performance, and a user-friendly design suitable for both personal use and professional development. One of the standout features of Ubuntu is its support for the ZFS file system, which is a modern filesystem known for its high availability, and improved guidance for dual-boot setups – this makes the system highly versatile, and suitable for various user requirements.
Ubuntu supports hardware-backed full disk encryption, providing an additional layer of security that protects user data.
- Debian: A non-commercial distribution and one of the earliest, maintained by a volunteer developer community with a strong commitment to free software principles and democratic project management. The progressive integration and stabilisation of packages and features, together with the project's well-established quality control mechanisms, has earned Debian its reputation of being one of the best-tested and most bug-free distributions available today.
- RedHat: The Red Hat company (currently owned by IBM) was founded in 1993 and quickly became well known as a commercial vendor for Linux desktop and server systems. The company developed Red Hat Linux and, later, Red Hat Linux Advanced Server. The latter was rebranded Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) in 2003. While best-known as being a commercially backed and supported operating system used in business servers and enterprise environments, Red Hat also provides free-of-charge licenses for developers, individual users, and testing environments.

## Section 3: Basic Commands
### Some hands-on commands to known
- whoami: my login
- hostname: name of this computer
- echo "Hello, world!" : print characters to screen
- echo $HOME : print environment variable
- date : print cureent date & time
- pwd : print current directory
- ls : list files
- ls -a : list all files, including hidden files beginning with a
- cd : change directory
- cd .. : change directory to parent directory 
- cd / : change directory to root
- cp [file1] [file2]: copy file
- mkdir [name]: make directory
- rmdir [name]: remove (empty) directory
- mv [file] [destination]: move/rename file
- rm [file]: remove (-r for recursive)
- cat [file] [file2…] : display file(s)
- tac [file] [file2…] : display file in reverse order
- touch [file] : update modification time

## Section 4: Conclusion
While Linux has been around for a very long time, it has been ignored for mainstream desktop use for most of its existence. Linux will run on a wider range of hardware than even Windows. It has also empowered developers and entrepreneurs aspiring to be in the industry. Linux developers have proven time and again that they are not here to follow a certain path of growth to make their mark in the changing landscape of the business.
